# Tv Show Tracker

I chose to create an app where someone can log tv shows that they watched and give/recieve recommondations to and from others. On this app once a user has signed up they can add tv shows to their personal list. Once a tv show is added they can edit and delete them as they please. There is also an option to recommend the tv show when creating it. If a user clicks this the tv show will be added to the recommended page where all users can see it.

## Getting started
You can find my [deployed site here](https://tv-show-tracker-aae077f6f5ab.herokuapp.com/)

My planning materials [can be found here](https://trello.com/b/8W2W4eyG/tv-show-collector)

## Technologies Used: 
1. **Python**
    * Python is the base code used to create this app.
    * Python controls the entire functionality of the website.
2. **CSS**
    * CSS was used for styling the site
    * By implementing CSS we were able to give our website a better feel and make it easier to navigate through the website.
3. **Django**
    * Django was used to allow model creations and to allow changes to a database
    * Django is also used to move from webpage to webpage


## Stretch Goals
Theres a few things that I would have like to have added given more time.

1. **A search functionality in the recommendations page**
    * Adding a functionable search bar in the recommendations page would make the user experience much better and allow them to find certain types of shows that they may want to watch.

2. **Removing duplicates in the recommendations page**
    * Right now if two users recommend the same tv show they will both show up. It would be nice to have a function that instead tallied the amount of users that recommend a show with an average rating by every user.
